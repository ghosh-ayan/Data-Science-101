Download and Install Git
Create a folder for all different Git repositories
Fire up Git Bash -
1) Set up user.name and user.email
git config --global user.name <git-hub user name>
git config --global user.email <git-user-email>

Next there are 2 options of starting a gitrepo:
1) Clone at existing repo from github by copying the url. Go to the GitRepo folder. Fire up Git Bash.
git clone https://github.com/ghosh-ayan/Data-Science-101.git
This will create the folder(repo) inside your GitRepo folder with git initialized.

2) Create a local repo and push it to Github. Create a local project folder. Fire up Git Bash there.
git init
git add .
git commit -m 'Initial Commit'

Then create a new github repository at github and link it to the local using 'git remote add origin'
copy the url.
git remote add origin <url of remote repo>
git remote -v (to check if its linked now)
git status (to see if everything is ready to push)
git push origin master


https://github.com/ghosh-ayan/Data-Science-101.git

git remote add origin https://github.com/ghosh-ayan/Data-Science-101.git

git remote -v

git push origin master
